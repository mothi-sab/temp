Objective
Add durable persistence, a human approval gate, and a focused agentic RAG subgraph that grounds the system’s recommendations in policy documents.
Required
•	Persistence: compile the graph with a Postgres checkpointer. Demonstrate stopping the process mid-run and resuming the same thread.
•	Approval: node propose_remedy calls payments.refund_preview, then interrupts for human approval. On resume, call payments.refund_commit.
•	Agentic RAG subgraph:
o	Add a small knowledge base of 8 to 12 short policy files in Markdown stored locally in the repo.
o	Provide an indexing CLI kb_index that chunks and embeds the docs into a vector store. You may use pgvector or Chroma.
o	Build a kb_orchestrator node that plans retrieval: choose retriever, run top-k retrieval, optionally call a reranker or an LLM-based re-scorer, and return citations.
o	Integrate RAG into policy_evaluator so proposed actions must cite relevant policy sections.
•	Observability: show the run tree and node metadata in LangSmith or Langfuse, including retrieved document IDs and citation spans.
Live demo
•	Start a run, stop the server, restart, and resume to completion.
•	Show an interrupted run that resumes after approval.
•	Show RAG citations in the proposed remedy and in the final reply.
